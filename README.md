contact_form
============

A secure ajax php contact form that can be used without javascript. Forked from the great tutorial at TutsPlus: http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/build-a-neat-html5-powered-contact-form--net-20426 

Adapted for Twitter Bootstrap. Form needs to be placed within a narrower column to look right.
